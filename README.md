# Medical-Chatbot
This advanced medical chatbot uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to deliver multi-turn medical answers. A custom corpus is embedded with FAISS, conversation context is tracked, and a Hugging Face language model ensures context-aware responsesâ€”demonstration only, not real medical advice.
